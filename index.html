				<p class="w3-justify">
					I have been programming on an almost daily basis since August of 2015.  The first programming language I 
					learned was VBA, and I used it extensively to increase efficiency in the workplace during
					my time at NIPSCO.  I learned about Raspberry Pi around May of 2016 and began sporadically
					learning Python and Bash commands.

					In October of 2016 I left my company and began studying programming every day, working
					for at least 8 hours a day.
